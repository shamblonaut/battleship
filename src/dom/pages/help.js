        If you are not familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">battleship</a>, here's a quick run-through of the mechanics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a two-player game, with each player having a board with ships arranged on it according to their wishes.</li>
          <li>
            There are 5 ships of varying lengths: 
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Ship</th>
                <th>Size</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Carrier</td>
                <td>5</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Battleship</td>
                <td>4</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Destroyer</td>
                <td>3</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Submarine</td>
                <td>3</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Patrol Boat</td>
                <td>2</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </li>
          <li>
            Each player takes turns shooting a square on the other player's board.
            They have no information on whether there is a ship on that square or not.
            After each try, they will be informed whether they had hit a ship or missed their shot.
          </li>
          <li>After all the squares of a particular ship is hit, it will be marked (and informed to the shooting player) as sunk.</li>
          <li>After all the ships of a particular board is sunk, that player loses the game, and the shooting player wins.</li>
        </ul>
